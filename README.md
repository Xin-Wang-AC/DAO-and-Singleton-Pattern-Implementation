This is a console application to explore the DAO and Singleton Design Pattern. It calls RecipientsBusinessLogic class on business layer in which it calls RecipientsDaoImpl class on data access layer, processes RecipientDTO as data transfer objects and displays the data in a formatted tabular form preceded by column headings.

•	Designed a Java console application using NetBeans IDE and MySQL, implementing Object-Oriented Programming principles and Design Patterns (DAO and Singleton)

•	Implemented a database solution that utilized JDBC to connect to a partial dataset of recipients of The Order of Ontario, managing data operations such as retrieval, insertion and deletion.

•	Developed a modular architecture with distinct Java packages such as the business logic, data access layer and data transfer objects, enhancing code organization and maintainability.

•	Conducted thorough testing and added Javadoc comments to ensure code maintainability, preparing for contributions in scrum meetings and updates to Jira tasks.
